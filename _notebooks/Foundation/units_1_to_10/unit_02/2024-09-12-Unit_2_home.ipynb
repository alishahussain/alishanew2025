    "- **The `new` Keyword**: This allows us to create an object of type `Book`\n",
    "- **Constructors**: When we make a `new Book()`, the arguments passed in are matched to the correct constructor, a special function which creates a new instance\n",
    "- **Class-wide variables**: These variables can be accessed with the dot operator\n",

    "By now, you should be used to working with different variables and data types in Java. Some of you may have asked a question regarding why the data type String has a capital S, while int is not capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: String is a reference type, while int is a primitive type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive types are the mosic basic data types in Java, and they always represent single values. On the other hand, Reference types are used to store objects and can have a variety of things stored.\n",

    "- `Integer` for `int`\n",
    "- `Double` for `double`\n",

    "But let's back off real quick. What is a Wrapper class?\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Java math module is a package that comes with `java.lang.Math`. All it's methods are static.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more straightforward than wrapper classes, but still important to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Methods\n",
    "1. `static int abs(int x)`: Returns the absolute value of an `int`\n",
    "2. `static double abs(double x)`: Returns the absolute value of a `double`\n",
    "3. `static double pow(double base, double exponent)`: Returns the value of the first value raised to the power of the second value\n",
    "4. `static double sqrt(double x)`: Returns the (positive) square root of a double value\n",
    "5. `static double random()`: Returns a `double` greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a code example using all of these!"
